<p>The Genetic Code Analysis Toolkit (GCAT) is a tailor-made software tool, to support and simplify the creation and mathematical analysis of sets and sequences of genetic code tuples, such as trinucleotide codes and their corresponding aminoacids. The main purpose of the tool is to provide a simple and modern user interface and a tool-aided approach, to create, transform and visualize sequences or sets of tuples, as well as to perform tests and analysis on those. Written in Java the tool is easy to enhance via an open interface, to add an arbitrary number of custom transformations, splits, tests and analyisis, as well as new controls to input and visualize genetic code sequences and sets.
