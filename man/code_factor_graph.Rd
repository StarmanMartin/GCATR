\title{Prepares a R igraph object.}
\usage{
code_factor_graph(code, show_cycles = FALSE, show_longest_path = FALSE,
  tuple_length = -1)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{is either a string vector or a string. It can be a DNA or RNA sequence.}

\item{show_cycles}{A bool value. If true the all edges which are part of a cycle are colored red.}

\item{show_longest_path}{A bool value. If true the all edges part of the longest path are colored blue.}

\item{tuple_length}{if code is a sequence, length is the tuple length of the code.}
}
\value{
A igraph (<http://igraph.org/r/>) object: An graph representing a circular code.
}
\description{
The funciton prepares graph G(X) object for a code. The following definition relates a directed graph to
any n-nucleotide code. Recall from graph theory (Clark and Holton, 1991) that a graph G consists of
a finite set of vertices (nodes) V and a finite set of edges E. Here, an edge is a set \{v,w\} of vertices
from V . The graph is called oriented if the edges have an orientation, i.e. edges are considered to be
ordered pairs [v,w] in this case.\cr
Definition 2.1. Let X Bn be an n-nucleotide code (n 2 N). We define a directed graph G(X) =
(V (X),E(X)) with set of vertices V (X) and set of edges E(X) as follows:
N-NUCLEOTIDE CIRCULAR CODES IN GRAPH THEORY 5\cr
V (X) = \{N1...Ni,Ni+1...Nn : N1N2N3...Nn in X, 0 < i < n\}\cr
E(X) = \{[N1...Ni,Ni+1...Nn] : N1N2N3...Nn in X, 0 < i < n\}\cr
The graph G(X) is called the representing graph of X or the graph associated to X.\cr
Basically, the graph G(X) associated to a code X interprets n-nucleotide words from X in (n−1) ways
by pairs of i-nucleotides and (n-i)-nucleotides for 0 < i < n.\cr
